### Use cases of Riddles

* [Riddle4](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle4.kt) - Some button that can toggle two states. For instance a switch between White & Dark theme.
* [Riddle5](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle5.kt) - Two input fields in a calculator that need to be summed up and the result should be updated every time one of the inputs change.
* [Riddle6](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle6.kt) - Execute two network requests in parallel and wait for each other and process the combined data.
* [Riddle7](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle7.kt) - You never want to show the same value twice.
* [Riddle8](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle8.kt) - Make an Observable "lazy" for some time. For instance, when wanting to postpone some UI action.
* [Riddle9](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle9.kt) - Cancel an Observable when something has happened. For instance, stop polling when the user has been logged out.
* [Riddle10](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle10.kt) - Get some user data and perform a network request with the user data and have both data accessible afterwards.
* [Riddle11](https://github.com/surajsau/RxRiddles/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vanniktech/rxriddles/Riddle11.kt) - Handle the click of a button right away but prevent double clicking by not handling multiple click events within a given time window.
